XMSTools are a bunch of little programs to test an extended memory manager (EMM).

- XMSAlloc will try to allocate an Extended Memory Block (EMB)
- XMSFree  will try to release an EMB
- XMSCopy  can copy the contents of an EMB/file to an EMB/file
- XMSReal  will try to reallocate (change size) of an EMB
- XMSLock  will try to lock an EMB
- XMSUlock will try to unlock an EMB
- XMSInfo  will display size and lock count of an EMB
- XMSUmb   may allocate/free an Upper Memory Block (UMB)
- XMSHma   may allocate/free the High Memory Area (HMA)
